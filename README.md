## 👋 About Me
I’m a curious and hands-on IT student at **42 Belgium**, passionate about learning how things work—from low-level systems and hardware to interactive applications and web platforms.

I enjoy building projects that combine **problem-solving, user interaction, and technical depth**.  
While I’m still exploring which IT direction fits me best, my projects show a strong interest in:
- interactive applications
- game-like systems
- full-stack experimentation
- performance and real-time interaction

Currently looking for a **job or internship** where I can keep learning, contribute to real projects, and grow as a developer.

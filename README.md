## 👋 About Me

Hands‑on **IT student at 42 Belgium** with a strong interest in **systems programming, interactive applications, and full‑stack development**.

I enjoy building projects that focus on **performance, real‑time interaction, and user experience** — from low‑level C/C++ programs to multiplayer web platforms.

Currently looking for a **job or internship** to keep learning and contribute to real projects.
